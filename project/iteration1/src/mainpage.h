/*! \mainpage CSCI3081 Robot Simulator Project
 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * The goal of this software project is to
 * develop a rudimentary robot simulator in which robot behavior
 * is visualized within a graphics window. The code is organized such that
 * robot behavior is separate from robot visualization, which allows for
 * automated unit testing using Google Test.
 * For this project, view area_viewer class and arena class are the main
 * class of this project. The window is created by the GUI.
 * User can use keyboard, mouse and command events to manipulate the robot.
 * There are some structs which composed to the Position and some parameters.
 * The arena object has robot, home_base, recharge_station and so on.
 * Plus there are collision events and change its motion status
 * through the properties of battery, sensor touch.
 * To follow the efficient design pattern, all the arena entities are
 * defined hierarchically and differently.
